Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE is a measure of the average prediction error for a set of predictions. In the context of recommendation systems, it represents the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual ratings. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.
In your case, an RMSE of approximately 0.9134 suggests that, on average, the predicted ratings are off by about 0.9134 units from the actual ratings.
Precision:
Precision is a metric that measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. In the context of recommendation systems, precision is often used to evaluate the relevance of the recommended items.
A precision of 0.4792 means that, among the items recommended by the model, about 47.92% were relevant to the user.
Recall:
Recall (or Sensitivity) measures the ability of the model to capture all the relevant items. In the context of recommendation systems, it indicates the proportion of actual relevant items that were successfully recommended.
A recall of 0.7452 means that the model captured approximately 74.52% of all relevant items.
